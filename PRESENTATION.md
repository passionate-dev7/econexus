# 🌍 EcoNexus
### Connecting Local Environmental Action to Global ReFi Markets

**Powered by Hedera Guardian Infrastructure**

## Slide 2: The Problem

### 🔴 Current Environmental Credit Markets Are Broken

- **Lack of Transparency**: Buyers can't verify the real impact of credits
- **High Barriers to Entry**: Small landowners and communities excluded
- **No Real-Time Monitoring**: Static, one-time verifications
- **Limited Credit Types**: Focus only on carbon, ignoring biodiversity, water, and soil
- **Disconnected from DeFi**: Environmental assets isolated from Web3 economy

**Result**: $2B+ market with trust issues and limited participation
