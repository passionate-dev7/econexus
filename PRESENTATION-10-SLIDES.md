## Slide 1: Title & Vision
# 🌍 EcoNexus
### Connecting Local Environmental Action to Global ReFi Markets

**Powered by Hedera Guardian Infrastructure**

*Building the financial infrastructure for planetary regeneration*

**$3B+ Environmental Credit Market → Transformed by Web3**

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### 🔴 Environmental Markets Are Failing Our Planet

**Current Issues:**
- **No Transparency**: Buyers can't verify real impact → Greenwashing
- **High Barriers**: Small landowners excluded → Limited supply
- **Static Verification**: Annual checks → Outdated data
- **Single Asset Focus**: Carbon-only → Ignoring biodiversity crisis

**Critical Gap**: Environmental assets disconnected from $2.7T DeFi ecosystem

**Result**: Only 2% of eligible land participates in carbon markets
